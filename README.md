## Skin cancer 

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States of America (U.S.A.), and is estimated that about 4.9 million U.S. adults were treated for skin cancer each year from 2007 to 2011, for an average annual treatment cost of $8.1 billion. [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26042651/),[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25442229/)

It is estimated that approximately 9500 people are diagnosed with skin cancer every day, and that one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25928283/),[4](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21708),[5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20231498/)

Skin cancer is the out-of-control growth of abnormal cells in the epidermis, the outermost skin layer, caused by unrepaired DNA damage that triggers mutations. These mutations lead the skin cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumors. The main types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma.

The main causes of skin cancer are the excess exposure to UV radiation from sunlight and the use of indoor UV tanning beds. Genetic predisposition is also a factor that increases the probability of skin cancer. [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20231498/)

If found early, skin cancer is highly treatable. Often a dermatologist can treat an early skin cancer by simply removing the cancer, but late found cancers becomes more difficult to treat. [7](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/skin-cancer/find/know-how) 

Dermatologists advises a regular self exam with a monthly periodicity. During each exam one should look for warning signs like changes in size, shape, or color of a mole or other skin lesion, the appearance of a new growth on the skin, or a sore that doesn't heal. If one notice any spots on the skin that are different from the others, or anything changing, itching or bleeding one should contact a dermatologist as soon as possible.
